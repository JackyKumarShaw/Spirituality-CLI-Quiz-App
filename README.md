# Ever tried a **Quiz on Spirituality**?!

Hey Guys! If you think you have even some minor degree of Existential Crisis, and so are started to having a spiritual inclination, then this app is for you.
I would love to know how much you know about Spirituality.
So if you have sometime to spare, please play this small quiz.

## RULES FOR THE QUIZ
1. There are 3 levels.
2. _Level-ONE has 5 questions of **simple YES/NO type**._
3. Level-ONE Full Marks = 2*5=10
4. _Level-TWO has 10 **MCQ** type questions each with **4-options**._
5. Level-TWO Full-Marks = 10*2=20.
6. _Level-Three has 15 **MCQ** type questions each with **3-options**._
7. Level-Three Full Marks = 15*2=30.
8. _To reach level-TWO **Minimum** Score needed = **4/10** in Level-ONE_
9. _To reach level-THREE **Minimum** Score needed = **8/20** in Level-TWO_
10. Each _**correct**_ answer will _**give**_ you **_2 points_**.
11. But each _**wrong**_ answer will _**take away**_ _**1 points**_.

## Leaderboard Update
If you have played the quiz and have proved the fact that you really know the deapths of Spirituality, by scoring a share-worthy score, then take a screenshot of it and send to me in any of the social media platforms, so that I can update my Quiz App's Leaderboad by adding your name into it with your score. :)
